# Final Project â€“ SQL Inventory Management System
During the last week of the Data Analyst course, our team worked on a practical SQL project aimed at simulating an order management system for a supermarket chain called VendiCose SpA.

# Project Goal:

-The goal was to design a relational database capable of managing the flow of orders between warehouses and retail stores, while keeping track of restocking levels for each product category.
The system needed to:

1-Update product quantities in warehouses in real-time based on sales at the stores.

2-Monitor restock thresholds to automatically trigger new orders.

3-Handle complex relationships, such as warehouses serving multiple retail locations.

# Project Contents:

1-Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram of the database.

2-SQL scripts for table creation (DDL).

3-Sample data population for testing.

4-Various query methods including.

# Queries for:
1-Updating stock levels after a sale.

2-Checking the available units of a product in the warehouse.

3-Monitoring restock thresholds to manage inventory.
